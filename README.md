# **[Kickstarter Challenge](/Kickstarter_Challenge/)**
**Continuing to exercise my Excel prowess**

---

>## ***Overview of Project***
>- Analyize data of over four thousand Kickstarter projects from 2009 to 2017.

>>### Purpose
>>>The point of this challenge was to put my prior practice with Excel to the test by organizing a large dataset. I already used the same Kickstarter data to learn the basic and intermediate features of Excel, but this project challenged me to apply what I learned to a more in-depth analysis. Using formulas, charts, pivot tables, and pivot charts, I was able to filter an abundance of different campaigns into condensed and organized data.

>## ***Analysis and Challenges***
>- Using the Kickstarter dataset already provided analyze theater and play campaign outcomes based on when they launched and their target funding goal. 

>>### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
>>>Using a pivot chart, we can see right away that the month when you launch your campaign matters a lot more than expected.

>## ***Results***
>>- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

>>- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

>>- What are some limitations of this dataset?

>>- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
